OwlCraft is a server plugin inspired by magic used in the animated Disney show `The Owl House`. This is a very minimal version of the plugin for other people to
submit changes and PRs.

If you're interested in looking at this plugin in action with exclusive spells please check out our own [server](https://link.headpat.services/owlcraft).
